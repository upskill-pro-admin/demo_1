# Git Commands

- git clone: takes a gihub repository and brings it down to our local computer

## these steps are after we have them cloned and we are making changes to our files/folders
### these all happen inside the terminal.
- git add: preps changes that we've made to our folder/files.
- git commit -m "Message (whatever you want to put)" - takes the added files, and bundles them into a nice envelope ready to be sent
up to github.
- git push
